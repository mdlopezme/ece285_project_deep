title = "Automatic contrast enhancement of low-light images based on local statistics of wavelet coefficients",
abstract = "This paper describes a new method for contrast enhancement in images and image sequences of low-light or unevenly illuminated scenes based on statistical modelling of wavelet coefficients of the image. A non-linear enhancement function has been designed based on the local dispersion of the wavelet coefficients modelled as a bivariate Cauchy distribution. Within the same statistical framework, a simultaneous noise reduction in the image is performed by means of a shrinkage function, thus preventing noise amplification. The proposed enhancement method has been shown to perform very well with insufficiently illuminated and noisy imagery, outperforming other conventional methods, in terms of contrast enhancement and noise reduction in the output data.

title= {U-Net-Based Medical Image Segmentation},
abstract = {Deep learning has been extensively applied to segmentation in medical imaging. U-Net proposed in 2015 shows the advantages of accurate segmentation of small targets and its scalable network architecture. With the increasing requirements for the performance of segmentation in medical imaging in recent years, U-Net has been cited academically more than 2500 times. Many scholars have been constantly developing the U-Net architecture. This paper summarizes the medical image segmentation technologies based on the U-Net structure variants concerning their structure, innovation, efficiency, etc.; reviews and categorizes the related methodology; and introduces the loss functions, evaluation parameters, and modules commonly applied to segmentation in medical imaging, which will provide a good reference for the future research.},
